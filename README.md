PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project involves creating a simple calculator program that takes two numbers and an operation as input and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation. The program should handle invalid input and operation selection errors.

OBJECTIVE:
To create a program that takes two numbers as input.
To allow the user to select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) to perform on the input numbers.
To perform the selected operation on the input numbers and display the result.
To handle invalid input and operation selection errors.

KEY ACTIVITIES:
Input Validation: Validate user input to ensure that the entered values are numeric.
Operation Selection: Allow the user to select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) to perform on the input numbers.
Arithmetic Operations: Perform the selected operation on the input numbers and display the result.
Error Handling: Handle invalid input and operation selection errors.

TECHNOLOGY USE:
Python Programming Language: The code is written in Python, a high-level, interpreted programming language.
Input/Output Operations: The code uses Python's built-in input() function to read user input and print() function to display output.
Exception Handling: The code uses Python's try-except block to catch and handle ValueError exceptions that occur when the user enters non-numeric input.
Conditional Statements: The code uses Python's if-elif-else statements to implement the logic for selecting and performing the arithmetic operations.
Functions: The code defines four functions (add, subtract, multiply, and divide) to perform the arithmetic operations, which are called based on the user's selection.
