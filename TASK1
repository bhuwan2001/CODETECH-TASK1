/'The code defines four functions:

add(a, b): takes two numbers a and b as input and returns their sum.
subtract(a, b): takes two numbers a and b as input and returns their difference.
multiply(a, b): takes two numbers a and b as input and returns their product.
divide(a, b): takes two numbers a and b as input and returns their quotient. If b is zero, it returns an error message "Error! Division by zero."
Calculator Function

The calculator() function is the main entry point of the program. It:

Prints a welcome message to the user.
Asks the user to input two numbers, num1 and num2, using float(input(...)). If the user enters non-numeric values, it catches the ValueError exception and prints an error message.
Prints a menu of operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and asks the user to choose an operation by entering a number (1, 2, 3, or 4).
Based on the user's choice, it calls the corresponding function (add, subtract, multiply, or divide) with num1 and num2 as arguments.
Prints the result of the operation using an f-string.
Main Block

The if __name__ == "__main__": block is used to ensure that the calculator() function is only executed when the script is run directly (i.e., not when it's imported as a module by another script).

When the script is run, it calls the calculator() function, which guides the user through the calculation process.

Error Handling

The code includes some basic error handling:

It catches ValueError exceptions when the user enters non-numeric values for num1 and num2.
It checks for division by zero in the divide function and returns an error message if b is zero.'/
